<h2><a name="main">BootChamp Help</a></h2>

<h3>About</h3>
<p>BootChamp is a small utility for quickly booting into Windows.</p>

<p>BootChamp greatly simplifies the way you can boot into your Boot Camp partition. Traditionally you would either open System Preferences and select your drive or restart and hold down the Option key. Both of these processes are cumbersome and take time. BootChamp reduces this task to a single menu.</p>

<p>The first time a restart is initiated with BootChamp, it will ask for the admin password. After this initial process, you will no longer need to enter your admin password again.</p>

<p>The next time you restart your computer, whether it's from within Windows or from turning on your computer, the original startup disk will be used. BootChamp does not modify your startup disk, it only temporarily sets the startup disk for the next restart.</p>

<h3>Custom Menubar Icon</h3>
<p>BootChamp can display a custom image in its menu bar if you prefer to use your own over the built-in. To use a custom image, open Terminal and type:</p>
<p><code>defaults write com.kainjow.BootChamp StatusImage &lt;path&gt;</code></p>
<p>where &lt;path&gt; is the absolute path of your image. BootChamp will not scale it, so make sure it's the right size. Then relaunch BootChamp. To use the built-in icon:</p>
<p><code>defaults delete com.kainjow.BootChamp StatusImage</code></p>
<p>and then relaunch BootChamp.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<h4>The "Restart into Windows" menu is disabled.</h4>
<p>Make sure your Boot Camp volume is mounted and visible in the Finder.</p>
<h4>I am getting an "authentication failed" or "must run as root" error.</h4>
<p>Delete the /Library/Application Support/BootChamp/BOHelper file and try again. A restart of the computer may help as well.</p>
<p>You can also view the logs at ~/Library/Application Support/BootChamp/Logs to see if there are any relevant error messages.</p>

<h3>Uninstall</h3>
<ul>
<li>Remove BootChamp.app</li>
<li>Remove /Library/Application Support/BootChamp/BOHelper</li>
<li>Remove ~/Library/Application Support/BootChamp/Logs</li>
<li>Remove BootChamp from the Login Items in System Preferences > Users & Groups (or Accounts on 10.6)</li>
<li>Remove preferences by running in Terminal <code>defaults delete com.kainjow.BootChamp</code></li>
</ul>

		<ul>
			<li>BootChamp now only requires entering the administrative password once, instead of before each restart (the most requested feature!).

		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>1.1
		<ul>
			<li>Requires 10.6 or greater. Built as a 32/64-bit binary.</li>
			<li>Important: BootChamp's abilitiy to temporarily set the startup disk does not work with the unibody family of MacBooks, which includes the Air and Pro (and possibly newer Mac Pros). As far as I'm aware, this is an Apple bug. Previous versions of BootChamp would restart but would not boot into Windows. This new version adds a workaround preference "Next restart only" which is enabled by default. In order for the app to work on these newer computers, you <em>must</em> disable this preference. Unfortunatey, this workaround will set the start disk for all future restarts, so you must change it back when restarting back into Mac OS X. <b><u>Note: this appears to be fixed in 10.6.3.</u></b>
			</li>
	
			<li>Added a preference "Launch at startup" enabled by default.</li>

			<li>If BootChamp finds more than one potentially bootable drive, it will list them in the menu to choose from. When a bootable drive is mounted or unmounted, BootChamp will update appropriately.</li>
			
			<li>Grand Central Dispatch is used when scanning drives to improve responsiveness of the application.</li>

			<li>Added support for Paragon NTFS drivers</li>

		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>1.0.1
		<ul>
